## [Unreleased]

### Added

- GitLab integration for detached, same-project merge request pipelines, with
  target/proposed baseline separation, retained artifacts and an optional
  persistent MR note. Includes a pipeline example and token setup guidance.
- `explain --report review.json --id <review-id>` retrieves a single saved
  review entry as JSON, preserving source evidence, provenance and audit
  details. It explicitly reports that freshness has not been checked and
  does not change approvals or gate results.
- Pre-install registry-tarball scans from pnpm v9 lockfiles, preserving aliases,
  workspace references and separate peer contexts. Requires optional yaml 2.9.1;
  local workspace source and patched/Git dependencies are not supported. Uses
  a separate scan origin and changes the engine fingerprint.
- Before/after source evidence in dependency reviews, with separate evidence
  for ambiguous predecessors and explicit limits when an indicator was not
  detected. Rescan both snapshots with the updated engine before approval.
- An audit of all current installations in JSON, Markdown and SARIF reviews,
  including unchanged packages and the status, reason and expiry of matching
  baseline approvals. Audit information does not change gate decisions.
- Opt-in persistent GitHub Actions PR comments through `comment-pr` and
  `comment-key`. Same-repository PRs reuse a bot comment; unchanged reports
  produce no edit. Comment failures preserve the job summary and gate result.

### Fixed

- Tarball scans accept node-tar timestamp fields and a single named archive
  root, fixing scans of packages such as `@types/babel__core@7.20.5`. Mixed
  roots, traversal, links and identity mismatches remain rejected. This changes
  the engine fingerprint; rescan both comparison inputs.

- Deep scans run parsing and AST analysis in a separate process with a five-second
  timeout per analysis. Timeouts and worker failures mark coverage incomplete
  instead of hanging the scanner or approving a partial result. This adds process
  startup overhead and changes the engine fingerprint; existing baselines require
  review. No total scan deadline is imposed.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-22

First public release.

### Added

- Offline `scan-lock` analysis of published npm tarballs selected by lockfile
  v2/v3, with mandatory integrity checks, bounded extraction, original source
  evidence and reuse of review/approval workflows before installation.
- Explicit separation of tarball and installed-package scan origins; crossing
  origins requires review rather than silently reusing a baseline.

- Deep-mode environment enumeration and network operation detail, with
  call-site evidence and review of newly observed operations even when the
  parent capability was already approved.

- Opt-in `deep` analysis in the review Action, with pinned parser setup and
  explicit coverage failures, including in report-only mode.

- Deep scans distinguish shell execution, direct process launches and unresolved
  launch modes in `child_process` calls. New detail requires review even when
  general process execution is already approved, with original call-site
  evidence in Markdown and SARIF.

- Optional TypeScript, declaration-file, JSX and TSX analysis through pinned
  acorn-typescript 1.4.13, with erased type syntax, typed aliases, scope handling
  and explicit unsupported runtime constructs. Missing typed-parser support
  keeps deep scans incomplete.
- Source discovery includes `.mts` and `.cts`, including declaration variants,
  in basic and deep scans.

- Experimental `scan --deep` and `scan-tree --deep` capability detection and
  import context, using optional Acorn 8.15.0 to resolve immutable loader aliases,
  `createRequire` and static templates with lexical scopes. Acquired modules
  contribute filesystem, network, process-execution, dynamic-evaluation and
  native-code capabilities with original source evidence.
- Potential local import paths from supported installation commands, with
  network/credential locations and unresolved-reference reasons in reviews.
- File-level correlation of network and credential indicators, with original
  locations and coverage limits in Markdown, JSON and SARIF reviews.
- Selective approvals bind installed file content and version, with optional
  UTC expiration through `approve --expires`. Changed content and expired
  approvals require a new review even when capabilities are unchanged.
- Filesystem read, write and removal capabilities, with per-operation evidence
  and gating even when general filesystem access was already approved.
- `review` reports dependency changes, blocking reasons and source evidence
  in Markdown, JSON and SARIF.
- `approve` accepts one dependency installation with a required justification
  and rejects stale reviews, incomplete scans and incompatible engines.
- npm lockfile v2/v3 dependency origins, including nested installations,
  aliases and workspace links.
- A GitHub Action that reviews against the PR target baseline and checks the
  proposed baseline separately. Code Scanning uploads are optional.
- Install-script allowlists for npm, pnpm and JSON consumers, including npm's
  implicit `node-gyp rebuild` command.
- Manifest coverage metadata and checksummed scan inventories.
- Detection of literal dynamic imports, optional `require` calls, internal
  module loaders and additional cloud, CI and container credential targets.

### Changed

- `--deep` analyzes all source files, including packages without install hooks.
  AST failures now make scans incomplete, exit with status 2 and prevent
  selective approval. Manifests record the analysis profile and bounded AST
  coverage details. Checks reject a basic scan against a deep baseline.
  Existing users of experimental deep scans must rescan before review.
- Manifest schema v9 includes filesystem operation detail, installed-content
  integrity and explanatory source/installation context. New selective
  approvals require a complete content digest. Context does not add risk
  points or blocking rules.
- Dependency approvals are matched by installation and version. Ambiguous
  predecessors require review instead of combining approved capabilities.
- Comparisons distinguish install-time scripts from build-only scripts and
  ordinary environment reads from credential-shaped reads.
- New endpoint hosts block when accompanied by install-time execution or
  sensitive-target access; other endpoint changes remain informational.
- Scan summaries show install-time execution before aggregate risk scores.
- Scanner and normalization improvements reduce repeated parsing and pattern
  matching. Measurements and limitations are in [Verification](docs/VERIFICATION.md).
- The engine fingerprint and manifest schema have changed. Existing baselines
  remain readable; rescan and review differences before accepting a new one.
  Scan commands exit with code 2 for incomplete coverage, and approval commands reject it. See
  [Reviewing dependency changes](docs/REVIEW.md).

### Fixed

- Top-level `--help` and `-h` exit successfully; unknown commands still exit 2.

- The npm package includes its linked usage, verification, contribution and
  security documentation. Pre-release setup uses a reviewed source checkout
  instead of an unpublished registry package.

- Incomplete reads and exhausted analysis budgets can no longer silently pass
  comparison or be accepted into a baseline.
- Endpoint and environment-variable collection no longer silently stops at
  20 and 40 entries, respectively.
- Reused scan directories no longer include stale manifests; interrupted or
  modified inventories are rejected.
- Discovery includes nested dependencies, workspace links and pnpm stores
  while rejecting symlink escapes outside the project boundary.
- Duplicate package installations retain separate manifests and approvals.
- Capability changes are checked even when the package version is unchanged.
- Detection handles comments, regular expressions, erased TypeScript syntax,
  `node:` module specifiers and common literal-obfuscation techniques more
  accurately.
- Git and Node directory aliases resolve consistently when locating lockfile
  entries on Windows.
