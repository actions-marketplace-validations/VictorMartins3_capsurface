# Reviewing dependency changes

`baseline` creates the initial reviewed surface. For later updates,
`review` explains changes and `approve` accepts one installed package at a
time. Both run locally, without network requests or dependency execution.

## Scan and review

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts
capsurface scan-tree node_modules --out .capsurface/manifests
capsurface review .capsurface/manifests --baseline capsurface.lock.json --out review.md
```

The default output is Markdown. `--json` emits a structured report; `--out`
writes either format to a file. Entries include the predecessor selection,
capability changes, new risk flags, source evidence and scan coverage.
Nonblocking changes such as a new `NO_COLOR` read remain visible.

Source evidence is shown for both versions. JSON retains current evidence in
`evidence` and adds `baselineEvidence`, grouped by predecessor version and
installation. Ambiguous predecessors remain separate candidates, not a merged
history. Baseline coverage gaps and differing scanning rules are identified.
Missing evidence means the scanner did not record an indicator; it does not
prove an operation was absent. For example, replacing `graceful-fs` with `fs`
can expose an operation the previous scan did not recognize.

This update changes the rules fingerprint because comparison wording is part
of the fingerprinted engine. Rescan both snapshots with the same engine before
approving an update; existing baseline rule-change warnings remain in effect.

The exit codes follow `check`: 0 for a passing comparison, 1 for escalations
or ambiguous predecessors, 2 for invalid inputs. Add `--fail-on-new` to
block unapproved new packages. `--report-only` preserves the findings but
returns 0 for a completed comparison; invalid snapshots still fail.
The report file is written even when the comparison returns 1.

## Inspect a saved review entry by ID

Save a JSON review and use its exact entry ID to retrieve one installation's
details. `explain` reads local data only; it neither scans nor approves anything.

```bash
capsurface review .capsurface/after --baseline .capsurface/before.lock.json --json --out review.json
# review may exit 1 for findings; its JSON file is still written.
capsurface explain --report review.json --id <review-id> --json
capsurface explain --report review.json --id <review-id> --out explanation.json
```

Output is JSON by default; `--json` is optional. `entry` preserves the saved
review entry, including changes, blocking reasons, evidence before/after,
coverage, integrity, source context and available provenance. A matching
installation audit is included as `audit` when uniquely available. Fields
absent from an older report are not invented. npm chains require generating
the original review with `--lockfile`; pnpm references come from its artifact.

`source.freshness` is always `not-checked`. Paths recorded inside a report are
descriptive and are never followed. The command can inspect old reports after
their scan inputs have been removed. Report data is not authenticated or
recomputed, and `entry.approvable` only describes the saved review. Use a fresh
`review` and the normal `approve` workflow for an actual approval decision.

`idKind: review-content-id` identifies the existing ID tied to comparison
content, not a permanent issue ID across package upgrades. Full IDs are
required; missing or duplicate matches are errors. Only review JSON schema 1
is accepted, not `check --json`, SARIF or Markdown. Input is bounded to 64 MiB.

Exit 0 means the lookup succeeded, even if `report.wouldFail` or
`entry.blocking` is true. Invalid input exits 2 with no JSON on stdout. `--out`
writes the result without a status message on stdout and cannot overwrite
the source report. This command does not replace a CI gate.

## Audit passing comparisons and approvals

Every JSON review includes `audit.installations`, even when `entries` is empty.
It covers the current scanned installations, not historical approvals for
packages that are no longer installed. `audit.counts` assigns each installation
to one state: `incomplete`, `unbaselined`, `review-required`, `approved`,
`unchanged` or `informational`, in that order of precedence.

`approved` means a selective approval from the selected baseline applies to
this comparison, with matching content and no coverage, engine or escalation
issue. `unchanged` means no review change was detected without a selective
approval. Neither state certifies safety. `unbaselined` remains visible even
when the default gate permits a new package; use `--fail-on-new` to block it.

Each installation records coverage status, rule changes and the actual
`blocking` decision independently. Approval statuses are `none`, `applied`,
`expired`, `invalid`, `not-applicable` (for example, changed content),
`needs-review` or `ambiguous`. Available reasons, timestamps, expiry and
selected baseline version/path are retained. Ambiguous predecessors cannot
lend approvals to one another. Approval data in the current scan is not used
as the audit's source of authorization.

The CLI joins reasons from the baseline's approval history only when one
record matches the package, version, installation, content digest, rules,
approval timestamp and expiration. Missing or conflicting history leaves
the reason unavailable instead of attributing a different review's reason.
Programmatic callers can pass this history as `buildReview`'s fifth argument.

The Markdown audit shows totals and recorded approval details. SARIF retains
the same audit in `runs[0].properties.audit`, including when `results` is
empty. Consumers must read these properties to display the audit; a SARIF
viewer may show only findings. The audit adds explanation without changing
gate decisions or creating extra SARIF alerts. `review-required` can also
identify stale scanning rules even where the existing gate does not block.

## Review published tarballs before installation

For pnpm v9, see [pnpm lockfiles](#pnpm-v9-lockfiles) below. The following
archive-map format and constraints apply to npm lockfiles.

`scan-lock` reads an npm lockfile v2/v3 and a local archive map. It verifies each
archive against the lockfile's strongest supported integrity digest, scans its
published content in a private temporary directory and writes the same manifest
inventory consumed by `baseline`, `review`, `check` and `approve`. It does not
install dependencies, run lifecycle scripts or make network requests.

Obtain the exact tarballs separately from your trusted registry or cache. The
map keys must equal the lockfile entries' `resolved` URLs; values are local
filenames, relative to the map file or absolute:

```json
{
  "https://registry.npmjs.org/example/-/example-1.0.0.tgz": "archives/example-1.0.0.tgz",
  "https://registry.npmjs.org/example/-/example-1.1.0.tgz": "archives/example-1.1.0.tgz"
}
```

Use a previously reviewed lockfile for the before snapshot:

```bash
capsurface scan-lock before/package-lock.json --tarballs archives.json --out .capsurface/before
capsurface baseline .capsurface/before --out .capsurface/before.lock.json
capsurface scan-lock package-lock.json --tarballs archives.json --out .capsurface/after
capsurface review .capsurface/after --baseline .capsurface/before.lock.json --lockfile package-lock.json
```

The map must cover every non-root lockfile package, including optional and
platform-specific entries; it is not filtered for the current machine. Add
`--deep` to both scans for AST analysis, or `--format sarif` to the review for
SARIF output. Existing review exit codes and selective approval apply. Creating
a baseline does not establish that the before version was safe.

Tarball manifests retain `scanOrigin: npm-tarball-v1` and the verified archive
integrity and resolved URL in `artifact`. Reviews identify that input kind.
Tarball and installed-package manifests cannot silently satisfy one another's
baseline: installation may generate, patch or omit files. Use separate baselines
and rescan both sides from the same input kind. Integrity binds bytes to the
provided lockfile; it is not a publisher signature or proof of benign content.

The archive reader supports gzip-compressed USTAR, per-entry POSIX PAX metadata
and GNU long names, including node-tar atime/ctime header fields. Files must
share one portable top-level directory, such as `package/` or `babel__core/`;
that directory is stripped before scanning. Mixed roots are rejected, and the
extracted package identity must still match the lockfile. It rejects traversal, links,
special files, conflicting duplicates, nonportable paths and case/Unicode
collisions. Benign `.` path segments and identical regular-file duplicates are
normalized; differing duplicate contents fail. File modes/owners are not
restored, and no archive entry is executed.

Limits are 64 MiB compressed and 256 MiB expanded per archive, 100,000 archive
entries, 128 path components, 4,096 path characters and 16 KiB extended metadata.
A lockfile scan permits 10,000 installations, 1 GiB compressed and 2 GiB expanded
in total. SHA-256/384/512 integrity is required; legacy SHA-1-only entries,
workspaces, Git/local dependencies, bundled `node_modules`, `.git` entries,
sparse files and unsupported archive extensions fail explicitly. These limits
can reject legitimate packages; no rejected archive is treated as a clean scan.

Missing archives, integrity/identity mismatches or extraction failures leave the
output inventory incomplete, so it cannot be reviewed or approved. Source-level
coverage failures retain a valid inventory for diagnostics but exit 2 and block
approval. Temporary extracted files are removed on completion or failure.

### pnpm v9 lockfiles

Files ending in `.yaml` or `.yml` use the pnpm v9 adapter. Install the optional
YAML parser alongside the tool, never in the inspected project. In a reviewed
capsurface checkout:

```bash
npm install --no-save --package-lock=false --ignore-scripts --include=peer yaml@2.9.1
```

For `--deep`, include `acorn@8.15.0 acorn-typescript@1.4.13` in the same install
command. YAML parsing requires Node >=14.6, runs in a separate process with a
five-second timeout and a 256 MiB V8 heap limit, and rejects duplicate keys,
aliases, custom tags and multiple documents. The default npm workflow does
not require YAML or access the network. See the [YAML parser documentation](https://eemeli.org/yaml/).

The pnpm archive map uses exact **package IDs**, not guessed registry URLs or
dependency aliases. Obtain the archives separately and map them as follows:

```json
{
  "string_decoder@1.3.0": "archives/string_decoder-1.3.0.tgz",
  "@types/babel__core@7.20.5": "archives/babel-core-types-7.20.5.tgz"
}
```

Every registry package in the lockfile must have an archive, including dev,
optional and platform-specific dependencies. Integrity and package name/version
are verified against the lockfile before scanning. Registry URLs are retained
only when explicitly present in `resolution.tarball`.

```bash
capsurface scan-lock before/pnpm-lock.yaml --tarballs archives.json --out .capsurface/pnpm-before
capsurface baseline .capsurface/pnpm-before --out .capsurface/pnpm.lock.json
capsurface scan-lock pnpm-lock.yaml --tarballs archives.json --out .capsurface/pnpm-after
capsurface review .capsurface/pnpm-after --baseline .capsurface/pnpm.lock.json
```

Do not pass a pnpm file to `review --lockfile`; that optional dependency-chain
resolver still accepts npm JSON only. pnpm metadata comes from the scan's
`artifact`: `packageId`, exact `snapshotKey`, direct `importers` and `parents`.
Each reference preserves its dependency alias and kind. These are direct edges,
not computed root-to-package chains. Markdown shows direct workspace references;
JSON and SARIF retain both edge lists.

Peer contexts remain separate snapshots. Their synthetic `installPath` is
`pnpm/` plus the SHA-256 of the snapshot key, not a physical node_modules path.
Updates with multiple possible predecessors keep the existing conservative
ambiguity behavior. These manifests use `scanOrigin: pnpm-tarball-v1` and must
not share baselines with installed-tree or npm-lock tarball scans. Both sides
must be rescanned after this engine update.

Linked workspaces must resolve to an importer within the lockfile. The command
scans their registry dependencies, **not project or workspace source files**.
Git/local packages, patched packages, unsupported resolutions, dangling graph
references and packages without snapshots fail explicitly. Configuration and
package-manager dependencies in importers are not supported. Limits include
10,000 packages, snapshots or importers, 100,000 dependency edges and the shared
archive budgets above. Missing or unsupported input leaves an incomplete
inventory rather than a passing partial scan.

Named roots and node-tar timestamp fields are supported, including the archive
layout in `@types/babel__core@7.20.5`. Other archive restrictions above remain
in force; unsupported inputs cannot be skipped to produce a passing scan.

## Accept one installation

Copy its 32-character review ID from the report:

```bash
capsurface approve .capsurface/manifests --baseline capsurface.lock.json \
  --id <review-id> --reason "Reviewed the HTTP client added for telemetry"
capsurface check .capsurface/manifests --baseline capsurface.lock.json --fail-on-new
```

Review the baseline diff and commit it with the dependency update. Approval
accepts all observed changes for the selected installation, not the entire
tree. Approving individual fields within one package is not supported.
The baseline records the ID, installation, version, engine fingerprint,
content digest, reason and approval time. Unrelated package approvals are preserved.

An ID binds the observed manifest, its candidate baselines and engine
fingerprint. Rescanning identical input keeps the ID despite timestamp
changes. If the observed manifest or its candidate baselines change, rerun
review; the previous ID is rejected. IDs cannot be approved twice. A lock
and atomic replacement protect concurrent approval writes.

Incomplete scans, incomplete content digests and manifests from a different
engine cannot be approved. Fix coverage or integrity errors and rescan first.
Approval does not certify that code is safe and never runs scripts.

### Content and expiration

Selective approval binds the installation path, version and SHA-256 digest
of installed package files. A change to any of those requires another review,
even when detected capabilities stay the same. Review IDs include the digest,
so changing a data file or binary also invalidates an outstanding review ID.
Run a fresh scan after changing installed files; checks compare saved manifests,
not the live filesystem.

Optionally set an expiration using an explicit UTC timestamp:

```bash
capsurface approve .capsurface/manifests --baseline capsurface.lock.json \
  --id <review-id> --reason "Temporary exception during migration" \
  --expires 2030-01-15T00:00:00Z
```

The timestamp must be in the future. At or after that time, `check` and
`review` require approval again, including for unchanged packages. Renewal
uses the new review ID and a justification; audit history is retained.
Without `--expires`, the approval has no time limit. Expiry uses the machine's
UTC clock; use a correctly configured clock in CI.

Manifest schema v6 records `contentIntegrity`. Its `package-files-v1` scope
hashes relative file paths and exact bytes, including `package.json`, binary
assets, documentation and non-source files. Directory traversal is sorted;
timestamps, permissions and empty directories are excluded. Nested
`node_modules` and `.git` directories are excluded. Dependencies are reviewed
as separate installations. This is an installed-content digest, not the
registry tarball's integrity or a publisher signature.

Hashing streams files with a 1 GiB package budget, 100,000 directory entries
and a maximum directory depth of 128. Unreadable files, package-internal
symlinks, other non-regular files and exceeded budgets produce incomplete
content integrity and prevent selective approval. The package root may itself
be a resolved workspace link. The scan does not provide a filesystem snapshot:
scan a stable installation, with outputs outside the package being scanned.

General baselines created with `baseline`, including older baselines and
older selective approvals, retain capability-comparison behavior. They are
not silently converted into content pins. New selective approvals store an
enforced policy with the baseline manifest and an audit record alongside it.
Different policies cannot be combined as equivalent capability surfaces.
Use the current CLI/Action throughout CI; older releases do not enforce these
policies. Regenerating the entire baseline replaces selective policies, so
use `approve` for subsequent reviews and inspect baseline changes in the PR.

## Multiple versions

Comparison selects the matching installation path first. Without a path
match, it can use an exact version or the only available baseline. Several
candidates with identical approved surfaces are interchangeable. Different
surfaces produce an explicit ambiguity instead of combining permissions.

pnpm changes store paths when versions change, and the current matcher
does not read lockfile dependency edges. If several different predecessors
remain possible, the report lists them and requires review. Approving that
installation adds its own surface without deleting the candidate approvals.
A predecessor still used by another current installation is also retained.

Old schema-v1 baselines are readable. Approval writes schema v2 and retains
the unselected entries. A rules migration is shown in review and should be
assessed separately from an actual package capability change.

## File correlation

Manifest schema v7 adds `sourceContext`. It records source files where a
network capability indicator occurs alongside a sensitive-target indicator
or a credential-shaped environment variable. Markdown and SARIF show the
file and the original line of each indicator; JSON retains structured data.

The scanner collects the first relevant indicators while analyzing each
file, independently of package-wide evidence quotas. A file can therefore
appear in this context even when it is absent from the category's five
evidence samples. `matchingFiles` counts all matching files; `matches` retains
up to 20, with the remainder in `omittedFiles`. Human-readable reports show
up to five file pairs. `filesAnalyzed` and `complete` describe source coverage,
not the number of retained samples. Older manifests without this field show
correlation as unavailable and can be rescanned to collect it.

This is explanatory context, not another blocking rule. Existing capability
gates, scores and risk flags are unchanged. Co-occurrence does not establish
execution order, a shared call path or transfer of credential data. Two
indicators may belong to unrelated functions in the same file, especially in
bundles. Conversely, code may pass data between different files. A zero count
does not prove safety, and incomplete source coverage is explicitly shown.

Correlation uses the existing source-text rules, including literal folding
and their detection limits. Lifecycle command strings are excluded from file
correlation; a `postinstall` network command is not attributed to an unrelated
source file that reads credentials. Potential import paths from supported
installation commands are described separately below.

## Installation script paths

Manifest schema v8 adds `installContext`, an explanatory graph of literal
import references from `preinstall`, `install` and `postinstall`. It runs only
for packages with non-inert installation commands. It never executes a script
or loads package code. `prepare` is not treated as a registry-install entry.

Supported entries are direct commands such as `node install.js` and
`node "scripts/install file.js"`. Shell combinations, environment assignments,
Node flags, script arguments, inline code and native build commands are
reported as `unsupported-command`, including npm's implicit node-gyp build.

By default, for recognized entries, the scanner follows literal `require`, simple
single-line ESM imports/re-exports and literal `import()` references within
the package. CommonJS file lookup checks the exact filename, then `.js`,
`.json` and `.node`; only files included in source analysis become graph
nodes. ESM references use exact filenames, consistent with Node's
[extension requirement](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#mandatory-file-extensions).
This is a subset of [Node's module resolution](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#all-together):
directory resolution, package exports and aliases are not implemented.

Each hook reports its entry status, reached file count and sampled paths to
network or credential indicators, including indicators in separate files.
Unresolved observed references include reasons such as `external-module`,
`nonliteral-import`, `unscanned-file` and `symlink-reference`. No dependency
outside the package or internal symlink is followed. Built-in modules are
recognized using the Node runtime running the scanner.

The graph is bounded to 10,000 files and 100,000 references per package, with
a maximum path length of 32 files. It retains 20 indicator paths and 20
unresolved references per hook, with omitted counts; text reports show five
indicator paths. `truncated` reports graph budget exhaustion.
`sourceCoverageComplete` describes source scanning only, not completeness of
module resolution. Older manifests omit this context.

These are **syntactic, potential paths**, not a call graph or proof of runtime
execution. Conditions, function calls, shadowed loaders, aliases,
`createRequire`, escaped specifiers and template interpolation are not
resolved. Unrecognized syntax can leave references unreported, so zero
unresolved references does not establish a complete graph. Reaching network
and credential indicators does not demonstrate that credentials flow to the
network. Risk scores and blocking rules are unchanged.

### Experimental AST import analysis

`scan` and `scan-tree` accept `--deep` to replace the installation import lexer
with an [Acorn](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/tree/master/acorn) AST pass and
add module-acquisition capability detection across every scanned source file.
Packages without installation scripts receive the same capability analysis.
Install the supported parser alongside your trusted capsurface installation:

```bash
# From a capsurface checkout; omit --deep to keep the dependency-free scanner.
npm install --no-save --package-lock=false --ignore-scripts acorn@8.15.0 acorn-typescript@1.4.13
node bin/capsurface.js scan /path/to/package --deep --out /tmp/package.json
node bin/capsurface.js scan-tree /path/to/node_modules --deep --out /tmp/manifests
```

For a packaged CLI, install `capsurface`, `acorn@8.15.0` and, for typed source,
`acorn-typescript@1.4.13` in the same trusted tool environment. Both parsers are
[optional peer dependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/package-json/#peerdependenciesmeta),
not installed automatically. Scans never download them. Missing Acorn or an
incompatible installed parser version fails before writing an inventory.
Missing acorn-typescript leaves typed files explicitly unavailable and makes
a deep scan incomplete; JavaScript-only deep scans still work with Acorn alone.
Parsers are resolved from capsurface's installation, not from the scanned package.

This mode resolves immutable `const` aliases of `require`, `createRequire`
from `module`/`node:module`, named and namespace imports, escaped string literals,
string concatenation and static template interpolation. `createRequire` must
use the current file's unshadowed `__filename` or `import.meta.url`; other bases
are explicitly unresolved. Lexical bindings, parameters, catch bindings and
hoisted `var` declarations shadow loaders. Reassigned bindings are not trusted.
It also visits actual calls inside template interpolation without treating
quoted examples as code.

JavaScript uses ECMAScript 2022 syntax. The optional
[acorn-typescript extension](https://github.com/TyrealHu/acorn-typescript)
adds TypeScript, declaration files, JSX and TSX. Both scan modes discover
`.mts` and `.cts`, including their declaration-file variants, in addition to
`.js`, `.cjs`, `.mjs`, `.ts`, `.tsx` and `.jsx`.

Type annotations, interfaces, type aliases, `import type` and `export type`
do not acquire modules. Declaration-file static imports are also erased.
Value imports remain acquisition candidates even when their named specifiers
are all marked `type`: TypeScript's
[verbatimModuleSyntax](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/verbatimModuleSyntax.html)
can retain these imports for side effects. No type checker or compiler options
are consulted to guess additional import elision.

The AST pass follows typed immutable aliases, `as`/`satisfies` expressions,
non-null assertions, generic calls and supported external `import = require()`
declarations. Constructor parameter properties participate in lexical
shadowing. JSX expression containers and spread attributes are traversed;
JSX text and quoted attributes do not become AST imports. The underlying
source-text scanner remains additive and can still report its own false positives.

Non-ambient enums, namespaces and internal import-equals aliases are explicitly
unsupported rather than assigned guessed runtime semantics. The pinned parser
also rejects some valid TypeScript, including angle-bracket assertions and
certain interface/value declaration merges. Malformed files, dynamic scopes,
module-namespace mutations/escapes and resource limits still make deep analysis
unavailable. Declaration files are parsed, not skipped wholesale.

`.cjs`/`.cts` and `.mjs`/`.mts` determine CommonJS and ESM loader assumptions;
other files use the nearest package.json `type`. Typed syntax accepts module
declarations without assuming a particular emitted build. The scanner does
not read tsconfig/Babel configuration or emulate Node's syntax-based module
detection. Only the pinned parser extension is loaded; no project plugins,
compiler transforms or dependency code execute.

Each file has a 1 MiB source budget, 100,000-token/node/evaluation budgets and
32 levels of static value resolution, in addition to the graph's existing limits.
Parsing and AST analysis run in a separate Node process with a five-second
wall-clock timeout per invocation (including startup), a 256 MiB V8 old-space
limit and a 16 MiB output limit. Timeout kills and reaps the helper and records
`ast-timeout`; crashes or invalid output record `ast-worker-error`. Both make
coverage incomplete. The old-space limit is not a total process memory cap.
This adds startup overhead per invocation; install-graph and package-wide
analysis may inspect a file separately. There is no total package scan deadline.
Inspected code is sent as data and never executed. This process boundary is a
resource safeguard, not a sandbox for running untrusted code.

Deep context has `installContext.schemaVersion: 2`, `analysis: ast-import-graph`
and `ast` metadata with parser identities and processed/unavailable file counts.
Manifest schema v9 also records `analysisProfile` and package-wide `astCoverage`.
Reviews retain this context in Markdown, JSON and SARIF. A parsed file does **not** mean every import was resolved:
mutable aliases, wrapper functions, values passed across calls, object-held
loaders and runtime monkey-patching are not modeled. Existing package-local
resolution and installation-command restrictions still apply.

AST module acquisition supplements the source-text scanner. Recognized modules
add filesystem, network, process-execution, dynamic-evaluation or native-code
capabilities, with original file/line evidence and the resolved specifier.
Existing scoring and capability-escalation rules then apply. Network findings
also feed file correlation and installation-path context. Unknown specifiers
on recognized loaders contribute `unresolvedRequire`; they do not become an
invented capability. This pass also attributes [process launch modes](#process-launch-modes).
It does not yet attribute filesystem operations,
data flow, and does not remove
false positives from the source-text scanner.

`analysisProfile` is `source-v1` for basic scans and `source-ast-v1` for deep
scans. Older manifests without a profile are treated as basic scans. A current
basic scan fails comparison against a deep baseline, including when capabilities
are identical. Baselines with different profiles are not interchangeable when
matching duplicate installations. Rescan with `--deep` to retain that coverage.

`astCoverage` records parser identity, analyzed/failed file counts and up to ten
file/line/reason samples, retained in Markdown, JSON and SARIF. Unsupported
syntax, parse failures and resource limits now make the whole deep scan
incomplete: `scan`/`scan-tree` exit 2, checks fail and selective approval is
rejected. A successful parse still does not prove complete runtime visibility;
unsupported aliases and dynamic values remain analysis limitations.

This is a deliberate change from the earlier experimental context-only mode:
rescan both sides of a review before interpreting new capabilities as package
changes. Some production trees remain unsuitable for strict deep scans; see the
[measured coverage and remaining limitations](VERIFICATION.md).
The composite Action defaults to basic scanning. Set `deep: 'true'` to use the
same AST analysis in PR reviews, including against an existing deep baseline:

```yaml
with:
  deep: 'true'
```

This opt-in adds a setup step that installs Acorn 8.15.0 and acorn-typescript
1.4.13 in the trusted Action directory, with lifecycle scripts, lockfile writes,
audit and funding requests disabled. Setup needs npm registry access; scanning
and review remain offline and never execute dependency scripts. Parser setup
failure stops the job. Use the CLI with a pre-provisioned trusted parser
environment for offline CI. No parser is installed or fetched by a scan command.

Deep coverage errors still fail the Action with `report-only: 'true'`; completed
reports remain available through its outputs and job summary. Turning deep mode
off cannot satisfy a previously deep baseline. Keep the Action pinned to a
reviewed commit, as in the example workflow.

## Environment and network operations

Deep scans record `envEnumeration` when supported code enumerates or copies
`process.env`: `Object.keys`, `values`, `entries`, `getOwnPropertyNames`, source
arguments of `Object.assign`, object spread/rest and `for...in`. Immutable aliases
and imports from `node:process` are resolved; shadowed `process` and `Object`
are excluded. Individual environment reads remain nonblocking, while newly
observed bulk access requires review. Enumeration is not proof of secret access
or exfiltration, and passing the environment to an unknown helper is not modeled.

Network call detail distinguishes these APIs:

| Capability | Supported operations |
| --- | --- |
| `networkRequest` | HTTP/HTTPS `request` and `get`, unshadowed global `fetch` and immutable aliases |
| `networkConnect` | `net.connect`/`createConnection`, `tls.connect`, `http2.connect` |
| `networkServer` | HTTP/HTTPS/HTTP2/net/TLS server creation |
| `networkDns` | Built-in DNS lookup, resolve and reverse APIs, including `dns/promises` |
| `networkSocket` | `dgram.createSocket` |

These describe the selected [Node network APIs](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html)
and [HTTP APIs](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html). A connection may use local IPC;
creating a server or UDP socket does not prove that it listens, sends or receives.
Instance methods, third-party clients, dynamic member names and wrappers remain
outside this operation pass. It does not classify HTTP verbs, destinations,
payloads, TLS configuration or actual runtime reachability.

New detail gates independently of the existing `network` or `env` capability,
without duplicating its risk score. Newly recognized global fetch or environment
access also records the parent capability. Review, SARIF, selective approvals
and engine-migration handling use the same evidence. These details require
`--deep` (or the Action's `deep` input); basic rules remain unchanged.
Recognized namespace mutation or escape to unmodeled helpers can make deep
coverage unavailable. Global monkey-patching outside the supported patterns
and data flow between functions are not resolved.

## Process launch modes

Deep scans add `execShell`, `execDirect` and `execUnresolved` beneath `exec`.
The parent keeps its risk score; a newly observed detail still requires review
when general process execution was already approved. Older manifests missing
these keys produce an engine-migration review rather than silently accepting
the new detail. Basic scans do not collect these call-site details.

| Capability | Recognized calls |
| --- | --- |
| `execShell` | `exec`/`execSync`, or `spawn`/`execFile` families with literal `shell: true` or a nonempty shell string |
| `execDirect` | `fork`, or `spawn`/`execFile` families with omitted options or literal options that do not enable shell |
| `execUnresolved` | Recognized process calls whose launch mode depends on unresolved arguments or options |

This follows the [Node child-process API](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html).
A direct launch describes the API invocation, not the executable: `spawn('sh')`
can still start a shell, and a directly launched program can execute anything.
The scanner does not infer commands, argument contents, runtime reachability
or safety. An absent detail is not proof that no such operation occurs.

Attribution resolves immutable aliases, literal members, named/default/namespace
imports and supported `createRequire` loaders of exactly `child_process` or
`node:child_process`. Shadowed functions and unrelated `.exec()` methods are
excluded. Evidence points at the call in the original source. Selecting an API
without calling it does not add launch detail.

Only inline literal options are classified. Options held in variables, spreads,
computed keys, getters, prototype overrides and unknown callbacks remain
unresolved. Mutable bindings, function wrappers and `.call`/`.apply` are not
resolved. Mutation or escape of a recognized module namespace makes that
file's deep analysis unavailable, as with `createRequire` namespace handling.
Markdown, SARIF and selective approval retain the operation-level change.

## Filesystem operations

Manifest schema v5 supplements the existing `filesystem` capability with:

| Capability | Examples of selected Node APIs |
| --- | --- |
| `filesystemRead` | `readFile`, `read`, `readdir`, `readlink`, `createReadStream` |
| `filesystemWrite` | `writeFile`, `appendFile`, `mkdir`, `copyFile`, `rename`, `truncate`, `createWriteStream` |
| `filesystemRemove` | `rm`, `rmdir`, `unlink` |

Synchronous variants and `fs/promises` are included. These flags describe API
selection in shipped source, not proof that an operation executes or that a
package is malicious. Named imports count even when a particular call is not
observed, consistent with the scanner's acquisition-based capability model.
Copying, renaming and truncation are classified as writes; deletion APIs are
classified as removal. The existing parent capability and risk score remain.
Operation detail does not add the same risk points a second time.

A newly selected operation blocks even when the parent `filesystem`
capability was already approved. For example, upgrading from
`fs.readFileSync(...)` to code that also selects `fs.rmSync(...)` reports a
new `filesystemRemove` capability, with the method's original file and line.
Review, SARIF and selective approval use the same operation-level change.

Detection supports direct literal `require('fs').method` accesses, named
ESM imports/re-exports, CommonJS destructuring and simple namespace bindings
such as `const disk = require('fs')` or `import * as disk from 'node:fs'`.
Member selection supports dotted access, literal bracket keys and `.promises`.
Comments, string examples, regex literals and recognized erased TypeScript
imports do not grant operation detail.

Namespace attribution is conservative and file-local. If a binding is
redeclared, used as a value, or its selected member is reassigned, its member
operations are not attributed. Function parameters that reuse its name also
prevent that attribution. This avoids guessing through shadowing or mutation;
it can miss legitimate operations in code that passes `fs` to a helper.

This is not AST or data-flow analysis. Indirect aliases, wrappers,
`createRequire`, dynamic imports, computed properties, template interpolation,
file-handle methods and `open` flags are not resolved into operation detail.
Lifecycle command strings keep their existing script-content gate but do not
receive these JavaScript operation flags. An absent flag means no supported
operation was recognized, not that the package cannot perform it.

Older baselines remain readable but lack these permissions. When a current
scan selects an operation absent from the baseline schema, the gate reports
`capability-detail-unreviewed` and asks for review of the engine migration.
It does not claim the dependency necessarily added that behavior. Rescan and
review with the new engine before approving; no operation permissions are
silently inherited from an older broad filesystem approval.

## Dependency origin and SARIF

Pass the installed tree's npm lockfile to explain who brought each dependency:

```bash
capsurface review .capsurface/manifests --baseline capsurface.lock.json \
  --lockfile package-lock.json --format markdown --out review.md
capsurface review .capsurface/manifests --baseline capsurface.lock.json \
  --lockfile package-lock.json --format sarif --out review.sarif
```

`--format` accepts `markdown`, `json` and `sarif`; `--json` remains an alias.
All formats preserve the same exit codes and gate decisions. `--report-only`
changes the exit status, not the SARIF severity or the reported reasons.

Origin resolution supports npm lockfile v2/v3. It follows physical install
locations, hoisting, nested copies, aliases, optional/peer edges and workspace
links. It reports one shortest root-to-package chain and up to 50 immediate
parents, with an explicit omitted count. Registry package dev dependencies
are not treated as installed consumer dependencies. Cycles terminate.
Missing paths, name/version mismatches and unreachable entries are reported
as unavailable; they never become an invented dependency chain. The limits
are 32 MiB per lockfile, 100,000 packages, 1,000,000 declared edges and 256
reported hops. Unsupported lockfile formats fail explicitly. pnpm, Yarn and
npm v1 provenance are not implemented. This explanation does not change the
baseline matcher or prove lockfile integrity.

Use `scan-tree` on the `node_modules` alongside the supplied lockfile. For
monorepos, `--project-root` sets the repository root used for SARIF paths;
it defaults to the current directory. The lockfile must be inside that root.
The Action sets this automatically from Git.

SARIF 2.1.0 contains stable rule IDs and installation fingerprints. Blocking
entries have level `error`; informational changes have level `note`. When
origin is resolved, the primary location is the package's version line in
the committed lockfile, so GitHub can associate the finding with a dependency
update. Source file/line evidence remains in the message and result properties.
Without a resolved lockfile entry, available package source locations are
used; these usually do not appear in a PR diff. Evidence is a category sample,
not proof of data flow or of execution during installation.

GitHub only shows inline PR alerts when their locations intersect the diff;
a valid SARIF file alone does not guarantee an annotation. See
[GitHub SARIF support](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/reference/code-scanning/sarif-files/sarif-support).

## GitHub Action

The repository provides a composite [Action](../action.yml) and a complete
[adoption workflow](../examples/workflows/capsurface.yml). Pin the Action to
a reviewed full commit SHA. It runs its own bundled scanner using Node;
no npm publication or project-local Capsurface binary is needed.

Before enabling it, commit an initial baseline on the target branch. Check
out the repository with `fetch-depth: 0`, set up Node 18 or newer, and install
project dependencies with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`. The Action scans the
installed tree; it does not install dependencies or execute their scripts.

It reads the baseline from the PR target SHA, emits Markdown/JSON/SARIF,
appends the Markdown to the job summary, and then
checks the proposed baseline. Changes stay visible even when the PR also
updates its baseline. `fail-on-new` defaults to true and `report-only` defaults
to false. The adoption example enables observation mode explicitly. Invalid
or incomplete scans fail in either mode. Review baseline edits using normal
branch protection and code review.

Inputs include `project-directory`, `baseline`, `lockfile`, `base-ref`,
`fail-on-new`, `report-only`, `upload-sarif`, `upload-artifact` and
`artifact-name`. Baseline and
lockfile paths are relative to the project. `base-ref` defaults to the PR base
SHA; outside a PR, specify a full target SHA or use an empty value to compare
with the proposed baseline. Outputs `markdown`, `json` and `sarif` are local
report paths; `would-fail` describes the proposed-baseline gate. Use distinct
artifact names when enabling uploads for multiple projects/jobs. Summaries
exceeding the display budget are shortened with a notice; local report files
remain complete.

Reports are generated in the runner's temporary directory, not committed to
Git. Artifact upload is disabled by default; set `upload-artifact: 'true'`
when downloadable reports are useful. Uploaded artifacts expire after 14 days.
The job summary works without artifact upload.

Upload to Code Scanning is opt-in
with `upload-sarif: 'true'`, `security-events: write`, and `actions: read` for
private repositories. GitHub supports Code Scanning for public repositories
and eligible organization-owned private repositories with GitHub Code
Security enabled. A private repository does not automatically qualify. The
Action does not change settings or purchase access; Markdown and optional workflow artifacts
work without Code Scanning. See
[GitHub upload requirements](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/how-tos/find-and-fix-code-vulnerabilities/integrate-with-existing-tools/upload-sarif-file).

The Action posts no PR comments and requires no comment-write permission.
When artifact upload is enabled, it retains `.capsurface-snapshot`; keep this hidden file when
copying or downloading scan inventories. SARIF and source evidence can
contain dependency source snippets, so artifact access follows repository
permissions.

## Optional persistent pull request comment

With a reviewed Action commit containing comment support, set `comment-pr: 'true'`
and grant the job `pull-requests: write`. The default remains off. Use a stable,
unique `comment-key` for each project or matrix job; keys accept letters,
numbers, dots, underscores and hyphens (up to 80 characters).

The Action creates a comment when there are findings or a failing/incomplete
check, updates its own GitHub Actions bot comment when the displayed result
changes, and updates it to show a passing result when the gate clears. An
initial clean review with no entries creates no comment. Changing only a
review ID does not cause an edit; use the full reports for approval IDs.
The comment distinguishes the proposed-baseline gate from the review against
the target baseline, so approving a proposed baseline does not erase the
comparison with the target branch. Long reports are shortened; changes in
omitted content still invalidate the comment fingerprint.

Only same-repository `pull_request` events are supported. Fork PRs and other
events retain the job summary without posting. Do not switch to
`pull_request_target` to bypass token restrictions or run untrusted PR code
with privileged credentials. The Action uses the job token only in the
comment step. Missing permissions or API errors produce a warning and leave
the independent capability gate unchanged.

Configure workflow concurrency per PR and comment key to avoid overlapping
writers, especially duplicate first comments. The example workflow includes
a concurrency group. The publisher also verifies the live PR's head and base
SHA before writing, but GitHub comment updates are not atomic with that check.
Use the standard `github.token`; custom bot identities are not supported.
Comments are optional and require a commit containing this feature: the
example's existing release pin intentionally remains unchanged.


## Credential flows to fetch

Experimental `--deep` scans record local static value paths from credential-shaped
`process.env` names to the global `fetch` function. For example:

```js
const token = process.env.NPM_TOKEN;
const payload = token;
fetch('https://example.test/upload', { body: payload });
```

The manifest's `credentialFlows` includes the source name, sink argument, and
original file, line and snippet for the source, alias uses and sink. JSON review
entries retain current paths and each baseline candidate's paths separately.
Markdown shows current paths; SARIF retains them in result properties and text.
No dependency code is executed.

The analyzer follows immutable local `const` aliases, string concatenation and
template interpolation within one function (or at module scope). It recognizes
credential values in the URL, local immutable options objects, and `headers`
values. Models also cover destructuring, simple JSON serialization, Buffer
encoding and flat URLSearchParams objects. Custom serializers, escaped or
mutated objects and overridden builtins remain unresolved. Lexical shadowing, binding reassignment and supported TypeScript
wrappers use the same rules as the import analyzer. Duplicate object keys follow
last-property semantics; spreads, getters and unresolved keys prevent object
attribution. The source name is a credential naming heuristic, not proof its value
is a secret.

A newly observed path requires review even if the package already had the same
network and environment indicators. Comparison uses the file, credential name,
sink API, argument, resolved request origin/path and method, including
occurrence counts. A changed path on the same host can therefore require review
when a credential flow is attached to that request. Formatting, line shifts and
local alias renaming alone do not create new paths. Moving a path to another
function in the same file with the same signature and count is not distinguished.
A baseline without this field yields `credential-flow-unreviewed` when paths are
found; rescan both versions with the same engine to compare them.

Simple synchronous local functions with identifier parameters and a single
return or call can be summarized through up to four active calls. Paths retain
parameter and call-site evidence. Async/generator functions, default/rest
parameters, mutations, multi-statement bodies and recursive summaries remain
unresolved. The model does not prove that a recorded call is reachable.

Mutable values, general user function calls, cross-file flows, credential files and
imported HTTP clients remain outside the resolved model. Unsupported operations
with identifiable credential origins at fetch inputs are retained in
`credentialFlows.unresolved`. New unresolved paths require review; an identical
reviewed gap does not block again. These leads do not establish a data flow.
File/parsing coverage is separate from value-analysis coverage, and the absence
of gaps does not imply complete JavaScript semantics.
Control-flow feasibility and runtime mutation through unknown calls are not
modeled. Files with recognized environment-property writes omit flow attribution
and record `environment-mutation` in `credentialFlows.errors`. A newly unavailable
file with previously reviewed flow evidence requires review. Source or parser
failures and skipped files count toward `filesUnavailable`. Absence of paths is
inconclusive. A recorded path does not prove execution, transmission or malicious
intent; authentication code may legitimately produce findings.

Flow tracing shares the isolated AST worker's five-second deadline. It also has
limits of 10,000 tracing visits and depth 32. Resolved and unresolved paths
each have limits of 100 per file and 200 per package. File diagnostics retain
up to 200 entries; exceeding that limit also makes coverage incomplete.
Exceeding those limits marks the scan incomplete and prevents approval. Basic
scanning has no flow field and still requires no parser. These changes update the
engine fingerprint, so existing baselines need review.

### Deep analysis execution and cache

Scans batch up to 64 sources, flushing at roughly 4 MiB of source text. A
supervisor reuses a parser subprocess within each batch and enforces the
five-second deadline per file. It kills and reaps a failed parser before
continuing with the next file. Single-source batches retain the direct worker.
Parser processes receive only platform/path/temp environment variables.

An in-memory cache retains at most 128 AST-analysis results and 8 MiB of
serialized results. Keys include source bytes, filename, module mode, parser
identity and the engine fingerprint. Results are copied on read; failed parses
and worker failures are not cached. Module/package context is resolved before
lookup. Nothing is persisted between CLI invocations, and the cache stores no
approvals or cross-file resolution decisions.
