**Review what an npm dependency update gains access to.**

capsurface scans dependency source and package scripts, compares them with a
reviewed baseline, and explains new filesystem, network, process-execution and
credential-access capabilities. Use it locally or in dependency-update PRs.

- **Review in GitHub Actions:** blocking reasons, source locations and npm
  dependency origins, with Markdown, JSON and SARIF output.
- **Approve one installation:** record a reason, bind approval to version and
  file content, and optionally set an expiration.
- **Inspect published content before installation:** scan local tarballs selected
  by an npm lockfile, verifying integrity without executing dependency code.
- **Offline scanner, zero required dependencies:** experimental `--deep` analysis
  uses optional, pinned Acorn and acorn-typescript parsers.

Early 0.x release. Static analysis is a review signal, not proof that a package
is safe. [Coverage limits](#limits) are part of the tool's contract.

## Terminal demo

![Terminal animation illustrating a synthetic dependency update blocked by capsurface](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VictorMartins3/capsurface/v0.1.0/docs/demo.gif)

Illustrative terminal demo with a synthetic dependency change. The review example
below includes source evidence and commands to reproduce the bundled fixture.

## See what changes

This is a condensed example from the repository's **synthetic**
`handy-color-utils` fixture, not a finding against a real npm package:

> **Dependency capability review**
>
> **handy-color-utils: 2.3.0 → 2.3.1 — explicit review required**
>
> The capability check would fail.

| Added behavior or indicator | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Filesystem reads | `scripts/setup.js:12` — `fs.readFileSync(p, 'utf8')` |
| Network access | `scripts/setup.js:7` — `require('https')` |
| Process execution | `scripts/setup.js:8` — `require('child_process')` |
| Credential targeting | `scripts/setup.js:18` — `process.env.HOME + '/.npmrc'` |
| Install-time execution | `package.json` — new `postinstall` command |

These indicators explain why review is required; their co-occurrence does not
prove that credentials are transmitted. Full reports retain separate evidence,
coverage information and an ID for selective approval.

Try the bundled demo with Node.js and Bash; it scans the fixture source without
running its payload:

```bash
git clone --branch v0.1.0 --depth 1 https://github.com/VictorMartins3/capsurface.git
cd capsurface
bash examples/run-demo.sh
```

The final check is expected to fail with exit 1; the demo itself succeeds when
it observes that failure. The source fixtures and [validation notes](docs/VERIFICATION.md)
make the example inspectable.

## Install and establish a baseline

Node.js >=14. No build step or mandatory parser installation.

```bash
npm install --global --ignore-scripts capsurface@0.1.0
capsurface --help
```

In the project being reviewed:

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts
capsurface scan-tree node_modules --out .capsurface/manifests
# Inspect the manifests before accepting the initial surface.
capsurface baseline .capsurface/manifests --out capsurface.lock.json
git add capsurface.lock.json
```

Creating a baseline records an approval; it does not establish that the starting
version is benign. Keep dependency scripts disabled until review is complete.

For a later update:

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts
capsurface scan-tree node_modules --out .capsurface/manifests
capsurface review .capsurface/manifests --baseline capsurface.lock.json --out review.md
capsurface check .capsurface/manifests --baseline capsurface.lock.json --fail-on-new
```

`review` writes its report even when it returns 1 for a blocking change. Use the
review ID to accept one installation after examining its changes:

```bash
capsurface approve .capsurface/manifests --baseline capsurface.lock.json \
  --id <review-id> --reason "Reviewed the new HTTP client"
```

An approval covers the observed changes for that installation, not individual
capability fields or every package in the tree. Commit the baseline diff with
the dependency update. [Review, content binding and expiration](docs/REVIEW.md).

## Review dependency PRs in GitHub Actions

The Action writes a job summary and JSON/SARIF reports. It compares against the
PR target's baseline even when the PR also updates approvals, then checks the
proposed baseline separately. It does not post a PR comment.

After committing an initial baseline on the target branch, add this job to a
workflow triggered by `pull_request`:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  capability-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 22
      - run: npm ci --ignore-scripts
      - uses: VictorMartins3/capsurface@922cae3e776b6e2a7460f1aec16c68a04673f948 # v0.1.0
        with:
          fail-on-new: 'true'
          report-only: 'true'
```

Start in observation mode, inspect the findings, then set `report-only: 'false'`
to enforce approvals. Invalid or incomplete Action scans still fail. Reports
stay in the job summary unless artifact/SARIF upload is explicitly enabled.
See the [complete workflow](examples/workflows/capsurface.yml) for permissions
and options, including experimental `deep: 'true'`.

The Action runs its own scanner checkout. For custom CI or npm scripts, invoke
a trusted installation by absolute path so a project-local executable cannot
shadow it: `node /absolute/path/to/capsurface/bin/capsurface.js`.

## Other workflows

`capsurface allowlist .capsurface/manifests` emits a candidate npm script
allowlist; `--format pnpm` emits `onlyBuiltDependencies`, and `--format json`
provides structured output. Check compatibility with your package-manager
version and review entries before applying them. An older script approval does
not approve an updated package's contents.

Keep `.capsurface-snapshot` with each manifest directory. It records scan
completion and excludes stale files. Do not commit generated reports or scans;
the reviewed `capsurface.lock.json` is the intentional versioned input.

## Limits

- The default engine uses source-text heuristics. Deep mode adds bounded AST
  analysis; neither is sound or complete. Computed runtime behavior, obfuscation
  and unsupported syntax can produce misses or coverage failures.
- Capabilities describe source indicators, not executed behavior. File
  correlation and installation import paths do not establish data flow.
- Scan commands exit 2 on incomplete coverage. Incomplete input cannot be
  approved. Basic and deep profiles, engine changes and tarball/installed
  origins require compatible baselines; see [migration and coverage](docs/REVIEW.md).
- Source scans cover supported JS/TS extensions and package scripts, including
  source under test/docs directories. They do not analyze arbitrary binary
  payloads, native behavior or IDE execution hooks. Content hashes are separate
  from capability detection.
- Tree scans support nested npm installs, workspaces and pnpm stores within the
  project boundary. Yarn Plug'n'Play needs a `node_modules` layout. Tarball scans
  require local archives and reject unsupported inputs, including workspace
  links, Git/local dependencies and bundled dependency trees.
- New packages fail only with `--fail-on-new`. Informational changes remain
  visible; not every observed capability or endpoint blocks the gate.

capsurface adds a baseline comparison to dependency review. It complements
advisory scanners, registry monitoring and runtime isolation; it does not
replace them. [Measurements and prior art](docs/VERIFICATION.md) describe the
inputs, results and limitations without claiming universal detection accuracy
or superiority over other tools.
